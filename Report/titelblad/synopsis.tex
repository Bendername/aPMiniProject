This report describes the development of an autonomous embedded system, which can map an unknown area.
More precisely, it deals with the type of problems that arise when creating an embedded system with memory constraints, computation constraints and so on.
The developed system attempts to solve a version of the \emph{SLAM} problem - \emph{\textbf{S}imultaneous \textbf{L}ocalization \textbf{A}nd \textbf{M}apping}.

The robot uses the Lego NXT brick along with motors and sensors.
The system is implemented in C++ using the firmware nxtOSEK.

Closing the report there is a conclusion which discuss the success the solution, as well as ideas for any future work if there had been time.
